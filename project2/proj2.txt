turnin code:  py_p2


Write a python3 pgm to find all potential genes (codons in the same
reading frame) in a sample set of DNA data.
The genes should be no less than 33 bytes and no more than 99 bytes long (inclusive start & stop codons),
*including* the start and stop codons.
Start codons are all either ATG or GTG, and stop codons are all TAG.
Both lower and upper case should be accepted.
Not all characters in the input will necessarily be A,C,G,T.
Your pgm should merely look for valid codons and accept all substrings
including codons that are of the correct length.

A gene is terminated by the stop codon nearest to its start codon in the same
reading frame, even if it causes the potential gene to be too short.
Note that genes may overlap, perhaps in different reading frames, or
two genes may even share a stop codon in the same reading frame.

(We have not covered regular expressions, and I do not recommend using them in
this project.  However, if you are familiar with them and choose to use them
anyway, be aware that overlapping strings are often not handled correctly.)

The input filename will be the only command-line arg.
The input will consist of lines containing a seqid followed by an arbitrary
amount of whitespace then a character sequence.
For example:

seq01  ___atg______________________________tag___
myseq    _GTG______________________________TAG________

For each potential gene, print a single line with five pieces of information:
    seqID  start_loc_relative_to_0  length_including_start_and_stop  start_codon  stop_codon
For example, for the above input, we would print:
    seq01  3  36  atg  tag
    myseq  1  36  gtg  tag

I will run the program on system64 this way:

    python3 yourpgmname  FN

where FN is the filename of a file containing input in the format described above.


Use the turnin system to submit just the python script for grading.

The program will be graded on system64 using the python3 command.
